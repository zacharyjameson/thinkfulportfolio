          <p>
            After completing my collegiate career with my audio production
            company audioshire. being the main monetary driver, I found myself
            searching for something more; another avenue of creation,
            development, and growth. Shortly thereafter, I sunk myself into a
            successful Technical Recruiting position as a way to expose myself
            to a myriad of potential career paths. Fairly early on, I discovered
            that my core values aligned with software development e.g. constant
            growth, learning, and building things; it became a natural interest
            and a skill that I have begun to fiercely nurture. The same work
            ethic, collaboration, and discipline that made funding my education
            through a passion project a reality will guide me toward a
            successful software & web development career. The next step in my
            career is ideally on a team of knowledgeable, hardworking, and fun
            developers where I can learn and grow myself into an indispensable
            developer for them.

              When I'm not developing my coding skills (which is rare these
              days), you can usually find me composing, editing, or playing
              music. I certainly try to keep my music abilities genre-fluid, but
              admittedly, my compositions have a strong tendency toward
              classical/instrumental, progressive rock; a la Ã“lafur Arnalds,
              Tycho, or Explosions in the Sky.
